* Magix
Build, cache and run possibly compiled scripts with dependencies using the Nix
package manager.

- Magix is simple and stupid.
- Magix is a tiny wrapper around =nix-build=.

* Next steps
- Property-based testing (e.g., generate arbitrary directives or even scripts).
  When creating arbitrary directives, one could test if the resulting
  Nix expressions are syntactically correct.
- We create random caches and hashes during tests. We could write an Arbitrary
  instance for =Config= to simplify this process.
