* Magix
Build, cache and run (possibly compiled) scripts with dependencies using the Nix
package manager.

- Magix is simple and stupid.
- Magix is a tiny wrapper around =nix-build=.

* Next steps
- Nix expression and replacement test helpers.
- Option to define cache directory.
- Python, make it happen.
