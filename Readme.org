* Magix
Build, cache and run compiled scripts using the Nix package manager. Magix is
simple and stupid. Magix is a tiny wrapper around =nix-script=.

* Ideas
- Log =nix-shell= command
- Clean.
- Refactor (separate HMagix module so that other languages can be added faster).
- Bash with runtime dependencies.
